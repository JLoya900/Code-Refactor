## <Module 1 Challenge>

In this project I am tasked with the consolodation of existing code and ensuring that all links contained in it are functioning. I am to rework existing CSS and html to make the webpage as user friendly as possible and meets all accessibility standards.

This project is the first of many I will work on for the UCLA coding Bootcamp and the Motivation for its completeness comes from my eagerness and hunger to learn both CSS and HTML and learning how to apply both in a work environment. 

#Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
