## <Module 1 Challenge>

This project is one of the first in the many I will begin to create for this UCLA coding Bootcamp. This assignment is not technically required so my motivation for it comes from my eagerness and hunger to learn both CSS and HTML The code I wrote for this assigment 

#Acceptance Criteria
